# If the vendored Cargo feature is enabled, the openssl-src crate will be used to compile and statically link to a copy of OpenSSL.
# The build process requires a C compiler, perl, and make. The OpenSSL version will generally track the newest OpenSSL release,
# and changes to the version are not considered breaking changes.
# The vendored copy will not be configured to automatically find the systemâ€™s root certificates,
# but the openssl-probe crate can be used to do that instead.
